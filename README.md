# HbCGM_paper

codes used to process the haplotype based computational genetic mapping output files and reported in {} paper

1 - HbCGM results

The result files from HbCGM for all the analyzed phenotypes can be downloaded from the following link:

2 - HbCGMEx.py

takes a typical results file and output a file, contains genes with coding SNPs (cSNPs) and expression values (TRM) in the organ of interest. 

3 - NLP 

you can use NLP based gene-phenotypes term search, of you choice, we used [phenolyzer](https://github.com/WGLab/phenolyzer), [Disgenet](https://www.disgenet.org/search) and [MGI](http://www.informatics.jax.org/)
