# HbCGM_paper

The codes used to process the haplotype based computational genetic mapping output files and reported in {} paper

1 - HbCGM results

The result files from HbCGM for all the analyzed phenotypes can be downloaded from the following [link] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HOI16TXqepgct3RTlt71AZjQ1njwuOAo?usp=sharing):

2 - HbCGMEx.py

Takes a typical results file and output a file, contains genes with coding SNPs (cSNPs) and expression values (TRM) in the organ of interest. 

3 - Functional and regulatory charactisation of SNPs:

For the charactiersation of functional and regulatory impact of SNP(s) containing genes [mMap](https://github.com/AhmedArslan/mMap) is recommanded, the repo was developed, especally, to understand the role of mouse genetic varistions in a given phenotype, you can read more about it [here](https://github.com/AhmedArslan/mMap). 

4 - NLP (Natural Language Processing)

you can use NLP based gene-phenotypes term search method(s) of your choice, we used [phenolyzer](https://github.com/WGLab/phenolyzer), [Disgenet](https://www.disgenet.org/search) and [MGI](http://www.informatics.jax.org/)
